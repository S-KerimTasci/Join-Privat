                    The contents of our pages have been created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the
                    accuracy,
                    completeness, and timeliness of the contents. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own
                    content on these pages
                    according to general laws, pursuant to § 7(1) of the German Telemedia Act (TMG). According to §§ 8
                    to 10 TMG, we are
                    not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to
                    investigate circumstances
                    that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general
                    laws remain unaffected.
                    However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a concrete
                    infringement. If we become
                    aware of any such legal violations, we will remove these contents immediately.

                    <br>
                    The use of our website is usually possible without providing personal data. As far as personal data
                    (e.g.
                    name, address, or email addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary
                    basis,
                    to the extent possible. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express
                    consent.
                    <br>
                    We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. communication by email)
                    may
                    have security vulnerabilities. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not
                    possible.
                    <br>
                    The use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation by third parties for
                    the
                    purpose of sending unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby expressly objected
                    to. The
                    operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the
                    unsolicited
                    sending of advertising information, such as spam emails.
