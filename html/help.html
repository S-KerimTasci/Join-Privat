                    <div class="subtitle">What is Join?</div>
                    <p> Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated
                        students as part of their web
                        development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.

                        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work,
                        limit work-in-progress, and maximize
                        efficiency (or flow). <span class="join-color">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to
                        help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
                        interface.

                    <div class="subtitle">How to use it</div>
                    <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="join-color">Join</span>:</p>
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td>1.</td>
                            <td>
                                <div class="subtitle-table">Exploring the Board</div>
                                <p>When you log in to <span class="join-color">Join</span>, you'll find a default board.
                                    This board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do",
                                    "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</p>
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>2.</td>
                            <td>
                                <div class="subtitle-table">Creating Contacts</div>
                                <p>In <span class="join-color">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your
                                    projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in
                                    the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they
                                    can interact with the tasks on the
                                    board.</p>
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>3.</td>

                                <div class="subtitle-table">Adding Cards</div>
                                <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
                                    individual tasks. Click the "+" button under
                                    the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card,
                                    like task name, description, due date, assignees,
                                    etc.</p>

                                <div class="subtitle-table">Moving Cards</div>
                                <p>As the task moves from on stage to another, xou can reflect that on the board by
                                    dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.</p>
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>5.</td>

                                <div class="subtitle-table">Deleting Cards</div>
                                <p>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
                                    Deleting a card will permanently remove it from
                                    the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
                                    irreversible.

                                    Remember that using <span class="join-color">Join</span> effectively requires
                                    consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the
                                    current state of your project.
