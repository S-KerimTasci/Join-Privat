                    <p><strong>Relevant legal bases under the GDPR:</strong> Below you will find an overview of the
                        legal bases of the
                        GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the
                        GDPR, national data
                        protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Furthermore,
                        if more specific
                        legal bases are relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given consent to the
                            processing of
                            his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Performance of a Contract and Pre-contractual Inquiries (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR)</strong>
                            - Processing is
                            necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the
                            implementation of
                            pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject's request.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legitimate Interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for the
                            purposes of the
                            legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such
                            interests are overridden
                            by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require
                            protection of personal
                            data.</li>

                    <p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany:</strong> In addition to the data
                        protection regulations of
                        the GDPR, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. This includes, in
                        particular, the Federal Data
                        Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz – BDSG). The BDSG contains specific provisions, in
                        particular, on the right
                        to access, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of
                        personal data, the
                        processing for other purposes, and the transmission and automated individual decision-making,
                        including profiling. In
                        addition, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p>
